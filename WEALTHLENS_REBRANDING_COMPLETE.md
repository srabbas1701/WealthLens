## 💬 Language Changes

### Neutral Terms Used
- "Intelligent Insights" (instead of "AI Insights")
- "Portfolio Analyst" (instead of "AI Assistant")
- "Get Help" (instead of "Ask AI")
- "Insights" (instead of "AI Insights")

### AI Still Present (As Capability)

- "AI explains concepts" (describes capability)
- But never in product name or primary labels

## ✅ Outcome

- ✅ AI remains present but not dominant
- ✅ Naming aligns across landing page and dashboard
- ✅ Mature fintech brand that builds trust
- ✅ No "AI" in product name
- ✅ AI positioned as capability, not identity
